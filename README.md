However, I understand that this might negatively impact your revenue, which is essential for maintaining and supporting your site. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience or disruption this may cause.

If this repository causes any issues, such as reducing your ad revenue or increasing traffic in a way that hinders your ability to monetize and maintain your site, please let me know by opening an issue, submitting a pull request, or sending a message to [me](https://facebook.com/dtdong08). I assure you that I will promptly remove the repository upon receiving your notification.

Additionally, I want to mention that I used AI to write this apology because I am not very proficient in English. Please do not think that I am joking or not sincere in my apology.

Thank you for your understanding, and I apologize once again for any inconvenience caused.
